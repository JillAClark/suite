OpenGeo Suite RPM Packaging
===========================

Setup
-----

In order to build rpm packages the following must be installed on the system:

  yum install rpm-build zip unzip gcc gcc-c++ libtool doxygen swig ruby python-devel ruby-devel libxslt-devel dos2unix flex desktop-file-utils openssl-devel

Uninstall PostgreSQL from the system first, leaving only the -libs package, so that the builds from our packages can be installed instead.

Install wxGTK:
  
  yum install gtk+ gtk+-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel libtiff-devel json-c-devel
  yum install ORBit2 SDL GConf2 gstreamer gstreamer-plugins-base libGLU libGLU-devel gtk2-devel desktop-file-utils openssl-devel

And additional deps:
  
  yum install wget 

wxGTK packages are needed to build pgadmin3. These dependencies vary a bit
between Centos5 and 6. For the Centos5 deps, grab wxGTK rpms from 
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/ :

    wxBase-2.8.11-2.el5.i386.rpm
    wxGTK-2.8.11-2.el5.i386.rpm
    wxGTK-devel-2.8.11-2.el5.i386.rpm
    wxGTK-gl-2.8.11-2.el5.i386.rpm  
    bakefile-0.2.8-3.el5.i386.rpm
    python-empy-3.3-5.el5.noarch.rpm

For Centos6, get the epel-release meta package from here:
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/6 and install it:

    rpm -Uvh epel-release*rpm

Then install wxGTK-devel:

    yum install wxGTK-devel

Create a file .rpmmacros in the home directory of the user who will build the
packages. Do *NOT* build as them as root. The file should have the following
contents:

  %_topdir <path to rpmbuild directory>


GDAL
----

The gdal.spec file expects a couple implicit dependencies to be present.

- Download the MrSID DSDK for your platform and untar it somewhere
  handy. Set the MRSID_ROOT environment variable to point
  there to the Raster_DSDK. (eg: export MRSID_ROOT=/opt/sid/Raster_DSDK)
- Ensure the Java JDK is installed. Set the JAVA_HOME environment
  variable to point to the installation location.
